## After a long hiatus I'm back again

After many years of neglecting my geeky side I'm back again.  Full of
energy and ideas.

### deneb.im

My first project was to set up deneb.im.  It's not complete yet but
getting close to it.  I still need to set up a secondary mail server
in case mail.deneb.im is down and there still are some bugs in the
backup system.

### Using OpenBSD again

I always loved OpenBSD but did not have the time and energy in the
last few years.  I hope this changes now.  I'm planning to make a
few ports that I miss from the ports tree.  Namely idris2 and
a new anki version.

### Teaching geeky stuff to my kids

My kids are getting old enough to comprehend more complex ideas.  The
time has come to teach them programming.  I really want to start with
functional programming but haven't decided which language to use.
Probably one of the schemes around.  Not that I think python would be
that bad, but I want to give them a different perspective before
it's too late.

That's already more than enough I think.

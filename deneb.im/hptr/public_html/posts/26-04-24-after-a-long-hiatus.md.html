<h2 id="after-a-long-hiatus-im-back-again">After a long hiatus I&#8217;m back again</h2>

<p>After many years of neglecting my geeky side I&#8217;m back again.  Full of
energy and ideas.</p>

<h3 id="deneb.im">deneb.im</h3>

<p>My first project was to set up deneb.im.  It&#8217;s not complete yet but
getting close to it.  I still need to set up a secondary mail server
in case mail.deneb.im is down and there still are some bugs in the
backup system.</p>

<h3 id="using-openbsd-again">Using OpenBSD again</h3>

<p>I always loved OpenBSD but did not have the time and energy in the
last few years.  I hope this changes now.  I&#8217;m planning to make a
few ports that I miss from the ports tree.  Namely idris2 and
a new anki version.</p>

<h3 id="teaching-geeky-stuff-to-my-kids">Teaching geeky stuff to my kids</h3>

<p>My kids are getting old enough to comprehend more complex ideas.  The
time has come to teach them programming.  I really want to start with
functional programming but haven&#8217;t decided which language to use.
Probably one of the schemes around.  Not that I think python would be
that bad, but I want to give them a different perspective before
it&#8217;s too late.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s already more than enough I think.</p>

## Hosting experiment

About a month ago I started deneb.im.  I just wanted to participate
somehow in the #smallnet community.  Since then I started a gopher
hole, set up self hosted email and I still have a few more ideas left.

 * gemini
 * irc
 * nntp

So there's still plenty of things to keep me entertained.

Interestingly the fun did not end with setting up all the services
and solving technical issues.  I new that one of my colleague is also
interested in gopher, so I talked about deneb.im and convinced him
to start a gopher hole as well.  A few weeks later one of his old time
friends asked for an account as well.  At the moment deneb.im has
three users, which sounds ridiculously few, but it gives me a sense
of giving.  I have not thought about hosting that way before.  So
thank you guys.  I'll do my best!

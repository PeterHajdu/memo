        Facilitated the weekly Haskell workshop.
        Held and mentored a semester of the Introduction to Haskell course. (https://github.com/PeterHajdu/introduction-to-haskell)
        Held several presentations about static type checking and advanced type level programming to leverage the type system to avoid mistakes. (https://github.com/PeterHajdu/presentations)
        Worked proactively on swapping out python with scala from convincing decision makers to implementation.
        Understood, learned basic concepts in data science / statistical learning.
        Got data science team closer to software engineering by working close with them and explaining basic concepts, tools like unit testing, git.
        Emphasized Behaviour Driven Development practices to get product and development team closer.Facilitated the weekly Haskell workshop.
